<h4><em>Abstract</em></h4>
<p><i>This investigation builds on existing research that shows
a positive correlation between highest level of education and political inclination.
We use the Naive Bayes classification method to support the conclusion
that at least some university education is correlated with an individual voting
for a liberal party and a non-university education to a conservative party.</i></p>

<div id="introduction" class="section level1">
<h1>Introduction</h1>
<p>Ever since Cambridge Analytica’s scandal more and more research has surfaced
on how to predict political inclination. It seems that the era of big-data
has completely changed our perspective of what’s possible.
One example, as mentioned, is how Cambridge Analytica showed that by creating psychological
profiles, based on survey questions, one can create
successful political advertisement strategies.</p>
<p>With this in mind, this investigation looks at the 2019 Canadian Election Study
(<a href="http://ces-eec.ca/">CES</a>), more specifically the online survey,
to investigate how some variables obtained from this kind of study can be
used to draw conclusions that help predict an individual’s political views.
Specifically we will turn our attention to the variable of highest level of
education.</p>
<p>The Pew Research Center is one of many groups of researchers that have
experience investigating
the correlation between education and politics. Their conclusion,
there is a positive correlation between highest level of education and political
views. We would like to point out that correlation does not imply causation, i.e. your education
is not necessarily the cause for what political party you choose. That is,
your education is just a variable, of many others, that as a result shape your political
decisions.</p>
<p>To draw a conclusion that supports the already existing research claims, we
first talk about the study itself, then about our data cleaning methods and
finally the analysis of the data using Naive Bayes classification methods.
The last section is dedicated to
the weaknesses of our approach and what will be our next steps.</p>

<div id="data-discussion" class="section level1">
<h1>Data Discussion</h1>
<p>The following short snippet written by the CES authors illustrates why we study
the CES data-set.
Directly from their <a href="http://ces-eec.ca/">website</a> “…the CES has been a rich source of data on Canadians’
political behavior and attitudes, measuring preferences on key political issues
such as free trade with the US, social spending and Quebec’s place in Canada;
political actors, such as parties, party leaders and the government; and social
concerns, such as women’s place in the home, support for immigration, and attitudes
toward gays and lesbians; as well as political preferences and engagement.
These data provide an unparalleled snapshot and record of Canadian society and
political life.” This description shows that, like Cambridge Analytica, the
data collected helps to ‘profile’ respondents.</p>
<p>The study, is a rectangular data-set with <span class="math inline">\(620\)</span> variables and
<span class="math inline">\(37822\)</span> observations. In this discussion we only look at two variables
“cps19_votechoice” and “cps19_education”. From the raw data, by
selecting such columns and piping them to the <strong>summary</strong>
function, the resulting output is:</p>
<pre><code>##                          cps19_votechoice
##  Liberal Party                   :8949   
##  Conservative Party              :8713   
##  Don&#39;t know/ Prefer not to answer:4908   
##  ndp                             :4328   
##  Green Party                     :2456   
##  (Other)                         :2210   
##  NA&#39;s                            :6258   
##                                                          cps19_education
##  Bachelor&#39;s degree                                               :9192  
##  Completed technical, community college, CEGEP, College Classique:7702  
##  Completed secondary/ high school                                :5865  
##  Some technical, community college, CEGEP, College Classique     :4394  
##  Some university                                                 :3716  
##  Master&#39;s degree                                                 :3207  
##  (Other)                                                         :3746</code></pre>
<p>As can be seen there is a significant amount of non-responses. This number is
even bigger when combined with all responses of type
“Don’t know/ Prefer not to answer”. To clean the data, we decided to remove
all rows that contain either <em>NA</em> or “Don’t know/ Prefer not to answer”, in
both the education and vote choice columns. This
is because, for the purpose of our investigation, they don’t provide any
information. The remaining data-set contains two variables and
<span class="math inline">\(4825\)</span> observations.</p>
<p>We proceed by clustering the data into two categories,
individuals that have at least some university education, and the ones that don’t.
We placed individuals into the “University” category if their response was one
of:</p>
<ul>
<li>Some University</li>
<li>Bachelor’s Degree</li>
<li>Master’s Degree</li>
<li>Professional Degree or Doctorate</li>
</ul>
<p>and into “Non-University” if their response was:</p>
<ul>
<li>Some/Completed Technical, Community College, CEGEP, College Classique</li>
<li>Some/Completed High School</li>
<li>Some/Completed Elementary School</li>
<li>No Schooling</li>
</ul>
<p>Then, to visualize the remaining data, from each category we calculated
the percentage of votes that went into each party and created a plot resulting in Figure <a href="#fig:highed">1</a>:</p>
<div class="figure"><span id="fig:highed"></span>

<p class="caption">
Figure 1: Percentage of Vote Choices Based on Education
</p>
</div>
<p>Figure <a href="#fig:highed">1</a> shows some slight correlation between the “University”
category and the liberal party and “Non-University” with the conservative party.
It is very interesting to point out that the liberal party (also the winning party in the 2019 elections)
takes about half of the votes combining both categories, this is somewhat different
from research performed in the U.S. like <a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/politics/2016/04/26/a-wider-ideological-gap-between-more-and-less-educated-adults/">this</a>
or <a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2016/09/15/educational-divide-in-vote-preferences-on-track-to-be-wider-than-in-recent-elections/">this one</a>
performed by the Pew Research Center.</p>

<div id="data-analysis" class="section level1">
<h1>Data Analysis</h1>
<p>To display how this data might be used to create a model we can use a very simple
but powerful probabilistic model commonly used in machine learning, a Naive Bayes classifier.
What we seek is an estimate of the probability of
a certain individual voting for party <span class="math inline">\(c\)</span> provided we know their highest level
of education <span class="math inline">\(x\)</span>. Symbolically we try to compute <span class="math inline">\(p(c|x)\)</span>, which by Bayes Rule is:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[p(c|x)=\begin{matrix}p(x,c)\\ \hline p(x)\end{matrix}=\begin{matrix}p(x|c)p(c)\\ \hline p(x)\end{matrix}\]</span>
Following the Naive Bayes method
we start by making the assumption that the education levels <span class="math inline">\(x_i\)</span> are <strong>conditionally independent</strong>
given the class <span class="math inline">\(c\)</span> from the following set of classes:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>Liberal Party</li>
<li>Conservative Party</li>
<li>Ndp</li>
<li>Bloc Québécois</li>
<li>Green Party</li>
<li>People’s Party</li>
<li>Another</li>
</ol>
<p>together with the two levels of education <span class="math inline">\(x_1=&quot;University&quot;\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(x_2=&quot;Non-University\)</span>.
To clarify, the initial assumption does not mean they are actually independent,
we make this assumption
because of the nice mathematical properties that follow. First we try to compute
two parameters <span class="math inline">\(\pi_j\)</span> for <span class="math inline">\(p(c=j)\)</span> and
<span class="math inline">\(\theta_{ij}\)</span> for <span class="math inline">\(p(x=i|c=j)\)</span>. These parameters are for
Categorical model
and the regular Bernoulli model respectively. In essence this method is just a
slight variation of the regular coin toss problem.
The estimation of each parameter will be done by computing their
respective MLE’s (Maximum likelihood estimate).
First the MLE for <span class="math inline">\(p(c=j)\)</span> is given by:
<span class="math display">\[\hat{\pi}_j=\begin{matrix}N_j \\ \hline N\end{matrix}\]</span>
where <span class="math inline">\(N_j\)</span> is the number of appearances of party <span class="math inline">\(j\)</span> in the data-set of size <span class="math inline">\(N\)</span>,
and the MLE of <span class="math inline">\(p(x=i|c=j)\)</span></p>
<p><span class="math display">\[\hat{\theta}_{ij}= \begin{matrix}N_{ij} \\ \hline N_j \end{matrix}\]</span>
where <span class="math inline">\(N_{ij}\)</span> is the number of appearances of party <span class="math inline">\(j\)</span> with education <span class="math inline">\(i\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(N_j\)</span>
is as before. It is not necessary to compute values for <span class="math inline">\(p(x)\)</span> since
<span class="math display">\[p(c|x)\propto p(c)p(x|c)\]</span>
Table 1 displays the
computed values for <span class="math inline">\(p(c)p(x|c)\)</span>.</p>

<p>The Naive Bayes classifier then uses Table 1 together with some input, say <span class="math inline">\(x=&quot;University&quot;\)</span>,
and then outputs the value with highest probability, in this example it would be “Liberal Party”.
Similarly for <span class="math inline">\(x=&quot;Non-University&quot;\)</span> the classifier would output “Conservative Party”.</p>
<p>This model helps to illustrate that with some profile data, like
the one in the CES study or the one collected by Cambridge Analytica,
we can model human behavior to a certain extent, even with the simplest of
methods. More sophisticated methods yield more accurate results, just
like more data similarly leads to better results.</p>

<div id="weaknesses-and-next-steps" class="section level1">
<h1>Weaknesses and Next Steps</h1>
<p>Perhaps the most clear weakness of this analysis lies in its simplicity. Although
there is theory surrounding what we did, we also cannot deny that this method
is just one of many methods that could be applied to analyze this data-set.
The biggest weakness is then the lack of other methods for comparison. Some
other methods may include other types of Bayesian Networks, Poisson regression,
and Negative Binomial Regression.</p>
<p>What comes next is to attempt what Cambridge Analytica successfully did,
create a model that given some number of features, predicts political inclination.
To find such features one could perform some sort of PCA
(Principal Component Analysis) to reduce the dimension of the original data-set.
Then, depending on the size of the remaining data, several
machine learning methods and deep learning methods can be applied.</p>
