# Introduction
Ever since Cambridge Analytica's scandal, more and more research has surfaced
on how to predict political inclination. It seems that the era of big-data
has completely changed our perspective of what is possible with data.
What Cambridge Analytica showed is that is possible to create psychological
profiles based on survey questions which can be used to create political strategies.

In this investigation we look at the 2019 Canadian Election Study 
([CES](http://ces-eec.ca/)), more specifically the online survey,
to investigate how some variables obtained from this kind of surveys can be 
used to draw conclusions that help predict an individual political views. 
Specifically we will turn our attention to the variable of highest level of 
education.

The Pew Research Center is one of many groups of researchers that has investigated
this variable and its correlation with political inclination. Their conclusion,
there is a positive correlation between highest level of education and political
views. To be perfectly clear, and avoid a 
misunderstanding, correlation does not imply causation, i.e. your education
is not necessarily the cause for your what political party you choose. To put it in other words,
your education is just a variable, of many others, that as a result shape your political
view. 

To draw a conclusion that supports the already existing research claims, we
first talk about the study itself, then about our data cleaning methods and 
finally the analysis of the data itself. The last section is dedicated to 
the weaknesses of our approach and what will be our next steps.


# Data Discussion

Directly from the CES website "...the CES has been a rich source of data on Canadians' 
political behaviour and attitudes, measuring preferences on key political issues 
such as free trade with the US, social spending and Quebec’s place in Canada; 
political actors, such as parties, party leaders and the government; and social 
concerns, such as women’s place in the home, support for immigration, and attitudes 
toward gays and lesbians; as well as political preferences and engagement. 
These data provide an unparalleled snapshot and record of Canadian society and 
political life." This short snippet of how the authors describe the study is
illustrate why we chose to look at this study in the first place. Similarly to
Cambridge Analytica this study in some sense helps to create psychological profiles
that relate with political ideology.

The CES online study, is a rectangular data-set with $620$ variables/features and
$37822$ observations. In this discussion we only look at two variables 
"cps19_votechoice" and "cps19_education". From the raw data the **summary** 
function outputs:

```{r votes, echo=FALSE}
summary(ces2019_web[c("cps19_votechoice", "cps19_education")])
```

As can be seen there is significant amount of non-responses, and even more 
significant is the amount of non-responses combined with all responses of type
"Don't know/ Prefer not to answer". To proceed, we clean the data by removing
all rows that contain either **NA** or "Don't know/ Prefer not to answer". This
is because, for the purpose of our investigation, they don't provide any
information. The remaining data-set contained two variables/features and 
$4825$ observations.

Next, we clustered the data into two categories,
individuals that have at least some university education, and the ones that don't.
We placed individuals into the "University" category if their response was one 
of:

* Some University
* Bachelor's Degree
* Master's Degree
* Professional Degree or Doctorate

and into "Non-University" if they have one of these responses:

* Some/Completed Technical, Community College, CEGEP, College Classique
* Some/Completed High School
* Some/Completed Elementary School
* No Schooling

Then, to quickly visualize the remaining data, from each category we calculated
the percentage of votes that went into each party. Figure \@ref(fig:highed)
shows these results:

```{r highed, fig.cap='Percentage of Vote Choices Based on Education', echo=FALSE, warning=FALSE, fig.height = 7, fig.width = 12}
# University Education
u_education <- c("Some university", "Bachelor's degree", "Master's degree", "Professional degree or doctorate")
uni_eductaion <- ces_raw[ces_raw$cps19_education == u_education, ]

uni_percents <- as.data.frame(table(uni_eductaion$votechoice) / length(uni_eductaion$votechoice))
names(uni_percents)[1] <- "party"
names(uni_percents)[2] <- "percentage"
uni_percents <- uni_percents[-c(8), ]
uni_percents$percentage <- uni_percents$percentage * 100

# Generate plot
hed_plot <- ggplot(uni_percents, aes(x=party, y=percentage)) +
  geom_bar(stat="identity", fill = I("springgreen3"), alpha=I(.9)) + 
  theme_linedraw() + 
  labs(title = "University Vote choices (n=3166)", x = "Vote Choice", y = "Percentage (%)") +
  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 90, vjust = 0.5, hjust=1), 
        text = element_text(size=16)) + ylim(0, 45)


# Non-University Education
nu_education <- c("Some technical, community college, CEGEP, College Classique",
                     "Some elementary school", "Some secondary/ high school",
                     "Completed technical, community college, CEGEP, College Classique",
                     "Completed elementary school", "No schooling")
non_uni_education <- ces_raw[ces_raw$cps19_education == nu_education, ]
non_uni_percents <- as.data.frame(table(non_uni_education$votechoice)/length(non_uni_education$votechoice))
names(non_uni_percents)[1] <- "party"
names(non_uni_percents)[2] <- "percentage"
non_uni_percents <- non_uni_percents[-c(8), ]
non_uni_percents$percentage <- non_uni_percents$percentage * 100

led_plot <- ggplot(non_uni_percents, aes(x=party, y=percentage)) + 
  geom_bar(stat="identity", fill = I("firebrick3"), alpha=I(.9)) + 
  theme_linedraw() + 
  labs(title = "Non-University Vote choices (n=1659)", x = "Vote Choice", y = "Percentage (%)") +
  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 90, vjust = 0.5, hjust=1), 
        text = element_text(size=16)) + ylim(0, 45)

plot_grid(hed_plot, led_plot)
```

Figure \@ref(fig:highed) shows some slight correlation between the "University"
category and the liberal party and "Non-University" with the conservative party.
What is very interesting to note is that the liberal party (also the winning party in the 2019 elections)
takes about half of the votes combining both categories, this is somewhat different
from research performed in the U.S. like [this](https://www.pewresearch.org/politics/2016/04/26/a-wider-ideological-gap-between-more-and-less-educated-adults/)
performed by the Pew Research Center or [this one](https://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2016/09/15/educational-divide-in-vote-preferences-on-track-to-be-wider-than-in-recent-elections/)
by the same institution.

# Data Analysis
To outline how this data might be used for model creations we can use a very simple
but powerful probabilistic model used in machine learning, a Naive Bayes classifier.
What we seek is an estimate of the probabilities of 
a certain individual voting for party $c$ provided we know their highest level
of education $x$. Symbolically we try to compute $p(c|x)$.
Using Bayes Rule the class probability is given by

$$p(c|x)=\begin{matrix}p(x,c)\\ \hline p(x)\end{matrix}=\begin{matrix}p(x|c)p(c)\\ \hline p(x)\end{matrix}$$
Following the Naive Bayes method
we start by making the assumption that the education levels $x_i$ are **conditionally independent**
given the class $c$ from the following set of classes:

1. Liberal Party
2. Conservative Party
3. Ndp
4. Bloc Québécois
5. Green Party
6. People's Party
7. Another

together with the two levels of education $x_1="University"$ and $x_2="Non-University$.
To clarify, the initial assumption does not mean they are actually independent, 
we make this assumption
because of the nice mathematical properties that follow. First we try to compute 
two parameters $\pi_j$ for $p(c=j)$ and
$\theta_ij$ for $p(x=i|c=j)$. These parameters are for
the generalized version of the Bernoulli model, also called the Categorial model, 
and the regular Bernoulli model respectively. In essence this method is just a
slight variation of the regular coin toss problem.
The estimation of each parameter, will be done by computing their 
respective MLE's (Maximum likelihood estimate). 
First the MLE for $p(c=j)$ is given by:
$$\hat{\pi}_j=\begin{matrix}N_j \\ \hline N\end{matrix}$$
where $N_j$ is the number of appearances of party $j$ in the data-set of size $N$,
and the MLE of $p(x=i|c=j)$

$$\hat{\theta}_{ij}= \begin{matrix}N_{ij} \\ \hline N_j \end{matrix}$$
where $N_{ij}$ is the number of appearances of party $j$ with education $i$, $N_j$
is as before. We can stop here because from Bayes Theorem we have that
$$p(c|x)\propto p(c)p(x|c)$$
and hence it is not necessary to compute values for $p(x)$. Table 1 displays the 
computed values $p(c)p(x|c)$.
```{r model, echo=FALSE}
# Probability p(c) for party c
pi_hat <- table(ces_raw$votechoice) / N

# # party "c" and "education" / # party "c" in dataset
theta_uni <- table(uni_eductaion$votechoice) / table(ces_raw$votechoice)
theta_non_uni <- table(non_uni_education$votechoice) / table(ces_raw$votechoice)

puni <- pi_hat * theta_uni
pnuni <- pi_hat * theta_non_uni

results <- cbind(puni, pnuni)
results <- results[1:7,]
knitr::kable(round(results, digits = 4), col.names = c("University", "Non-University"), 
             align = "ccc", caption="Proportional values to $p(c|x)$")
```

The Naive Bayes classifier then uses Table 1 together with some input, say $x="University"$,
and then outputs the value with highest probability, in this example it would be "Liberal Party".
Similarly for $x="Non-University"$ the classifier would output "Conservative Party".

This model helps to illustrate that with some profile data, like 
the one in the CES study or the one collected by Cambridge Analytica, 
we can model human behavior to a certain extent even with the simplest of 
methods. More sophisticated methods yield more accurate and precise results, just
like more data yields better results. 


# Weaknesses and Next Steps
Perhaps the most clear weakness of this analysis lies in its simplicity. Although
there is theory surrounding what we did, we also cannot deny that this method
is just one of many methods that could be applied to analyze this data-set.
The biggest weakness is perhaps the lack of other methods for comparison. Some 
other methods may include other types of Bayesian Networks, Poisson regression, 
and Negative Binomial Regression.

What comes next is to perhaps attempt what Cambridge Analytica successfully did,
create a model that given some number of features, predicts the political inclination
of an individual. To find such features one could perform some sort of PCA
(Principal Component Analysis) to reduce the dimension of the original data-set. 
Then, depending on the size of the remaining data, we could attempt different 
machine learning methods, to create an accurate model.
