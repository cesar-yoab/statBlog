# Introduction
Ever since Cambridge Analytica's scandal more and more research has surfaced
on how to predict political inclination, it seems that the era of big-data
has completely changed how we view the world. In the search to find a "good" 
model for predicting political inclination, one variable that keeps comming up
is that of education. The Pew Research Center has published numerous articles in
which they discuss the relationship between highest education level and political
inclination. Some of the more notorious ones, come from way back in 2015 and 2016.
Surveys were performed in order to create these articles, which differs with
our approach.

This time we are using already collected data from the 2019 Canadian Election
Study (gcc)[http:://www.ces-eec.ca/]

You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
fit <- lm(dist ~ speed, data = cars)
fit
```

# Including Plots

You can also embed plots. See Figure \@ref(fig:pie) for example:

```{r pie, fig.cap='A fancy pie chart.', tidy=FALSE}
par(mar = c(0, 1, 0, 1))
pie(
  c(280, 60, 20),
  c('Sky', 'Sunny side of pyramid', 'Shady side of pyramid'),
  col = c('#0292D8', '#F7EA39', '#C4B632'),
  init.angle = -50, border = NA
)
```
