      <description>Introduction Ever since Cambridge Analyticaâ€™s scandal, more and more research has surfaced on how to predict political inclination. It seems that the era of big-data has completely changed our perspective of what is possible with data. What Cambridge Analytica showed is that is possible to create psychological profiles based on survey questions which can be used to create political strategies.
In this investigation we look at the 2019 Canadian Election Study (CES), more specifically the online survey, to investigate how some variables obtained from this kind of surveys can be used to draw conclusions that help predict an individual political views.</description>
